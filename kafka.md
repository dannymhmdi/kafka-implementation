### if you want produce message and consume by multi-services should use different groupid for 
each service . see implementation in this repo

### ðŸ§© Partition in Kafka
- Partition is a subset of a Kafka topic.

- Each topic is split into one or more partitions.

- Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally by distributing data and load across multiple brokers.

- Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages.

- Partitions enable parallel processing because different consumers in a consumer group can read from different partitions simultaneously.


### Why partitions matter:
- They increase throughput by allowing messages to be spread across brokers.

- They maintain message order within a partition (but not across partitions).

- They provide fault tolerance through replication.

### notice:
- Each consumer in a consumer group is assigned one or more unique partitions of a topic.

- No two consumers in the same consumer group will consume the same partition simultaneously.

- This ensures each message in a partition is processed by exactly one consumer in that group, enabling parallelism without duplication.


| Concept                         | Explanation                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consumer Group**              | A set of consumers sharing the workload of a topic.                    |
| **Partition Assignment**        | Kafka assigns each partition to only one consumer in the group.        |
| **If #Consumers > #Partitions** | Some consumers will be idle because partitions can't be split further. |
| **If #Partitions > #Consumers** | Some consumers will consume multiple partitions.                       |


### What happens when you consume with 2 different group IDs?
- Each group ID represents a separate consumer group.

- Kafka treats each consumer group independently.

- Each group will receive every message from the topic, regardless of what other groups do.

- This is exactly how you enable multiple independent services to consume the same topic messages without interfering.
- So group-A and group-B each consume all partitions independently.

- If your topic has 3 partitions (P0, P1, P2), each group will receive every message from P0â€“P2.

### Question:so messages spread in to different partitions of a topic?

Messages in Kafka are spread (distributed) across different partitions of a topic â€” not duplicated.
